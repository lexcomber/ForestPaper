Title: Fuzzy difference and data primitives: a transparent approach for supporting different definitions of `forest` in the context of REDD+

Authors: Alexis Comber & Werner Kuhn

# Abstract
This paper explores the use of fuzzy difference methods in order to understand the boundaries between different forest classes. The context for this work is provided by REDD+ which seeks to reduce the net emissions of greenhouse gases by rewarding the conservation of forests in developing countries. REDD+ requires that local inventories of forest are undertaken and payments are made on the basis of the amount of forest (and associated carbon) that are mapped. At the most basic level this involves classifying land into forest and non-forest. However, the critical issues affecting the uptake, buy-in and ultimately the success of REDD+ are the lack over universally agreed definition of forest to support REDD+ mapping activities, and where such a definition is imposed, the marginalization of local community voices and local landscape conceptualizations. This tension is at the heart of REDD+. The methods described in this paper link methods previously to quantify fuzzy land cover change to notions of data primitives, which have been previously proposed as an approach to move between land cover classes with different semantics. Together these provide a transparent method to translate between alternative conceptualization of the forest, to allow plural version of forest to be mapped and to be quantified.
